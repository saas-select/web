<TextBlock title="If you think AI is going to take your job, you’re right." icon="" items="{[
	{ text: "AI is just a tool, just like Excel, the Calculator, the Car, the Oven. Yes, you can live without these innovations – humans are remarkably adaptable. But these tools – like so many others – provide great benefits for us in our daily lives. We are toolmakers. We are tool users. This is ingrained in our species. Although many of us see change as something threatening – or at least challenging – change is what brings progress." },
	{ text: "Humans who embrace tools, excel over humans who do not. We, therefore, urge you to embrace AI, just as (we hope) you have come to embrace the other tools mentioned. We hope you’re not lighting a fire in your living room to cook, but that you use the wonderful innovation we call a stove. We hope that you’re not doing all your calculations by hand, but that you instead rely on tools such as the Calculator and spreadsheets."},
	{ text: `Adapting to new tools will continue to bring humanity forward. If you’d like an empathetic, guided hand approach to AI, <a href='/courses/adapting-to-ai/'>please feel free to reach out</a>. We can help individuals as well as entire teams or departments. We’re on your side and we’re here to make your lives better.` },
	{ text: "If you think AI is going to take your job, you’re right. If you think AI is a wonderful new tool that will help you be more productive and excel in whatever you pursue, you are also right." }
